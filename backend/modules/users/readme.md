# Module 1: Authentication (sign up, sign in and user management in general)

## Ngrok:
- Run the server first.
- Note the port the server is running, and use this command.
```
ngrok http ${PORT}
```
Note: Can add --region area for lower latency. Ex:
```
ngrok http --region jp ${PORT}
```

## For me who use conda:
```
cd backend
activate
conda activate e:\Navigate\backend\.conda
```
